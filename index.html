          <h1>Twelfth Symposium on Compositional Structures (SYCO 12)</h1>
          <div id="location">Birmingham, UK</div>

      <p>
        The <i>Symposium on Compositional Structures</i> is a series of
        interdisciplinary meetings aiming to support the growing community of
        researchers interested in the phenomenon of compositionality, from both
        applied and abstract perspectives, and in particular where category
        theory serves as a unifying common language. We welcome submissions from
        researchers across computer science, mathematics, physics, philosophy,
        and beyond, with the aim of fostering friendly discussion, disseminating
        new ideas, and spreading knowledge between fields. Submission is
        encouraged for both mature research and work in progress, and by both
        established academics and junior researchers, including students.
      </p>
      <p>
        Submission is easy, with no format requirements or page restrictions.
        The meeting does not have proceedings, so work can be submitted even if
        it has been submitted or published elsewhere. You could submit
        work-in-progress, or a recently completed paper, or even a PhD or
        Masters thesis.
      </p>
      <p>
        While no list of topics could be exhaustive, <i>SYCO</i> welcomes
        submissions with a compositional focus related to any of the following
        areas, in particular from the perspective of category theory:
      </p>
      <ul>
        {%- for area in areas -%}
        <li>
          <b>{{ area.name }}</b>
          including
          {%- for inc in area.including -%}
            {%- if forloop.last -%}and{%- endif %}
            {{ inc }}
            {%- if not forloop.last %}, {% endif-%}
          {%- endfor -%}
          {%- if not forloop.last -%};{%- endif %}
        </li>
        {%- endfor -%}
      </ul>
      <p>
        This new series aims to bring together the communities behind many
        previous successful events which have taken place over the last decade,
        including {%- for event in events -%} {%- if forloop.last -%}and{%-
        endif %}
        <i><a href="{{ event.web }}/">{{ event.name }}</a></i>
        {%- if not forloop.last %}, {% endif -%} {%- endfor -%}.
      </p>
      <p>
        This event follows
        {%- for edition in previous -%}
          {%- if forloop.last-%}and{%- endif %}
          <i><a href="../{{ edition.no }}/">SYCO {{ edition.no }}</a></i> in

      <p>
        Submissions should present research results in sufficient detail to
        allow them to be properly considered by members of the programme
        committee, who will assess their interest to the <i>SYCO</i> community.
        We encourage the submission of work in progress, as well as mature
        results. There are no proceedings, so work can be submitted even if it
        has been previously published, or has been submitted for consideration
        elsewhere. There is no specific formatting requirement, and no page
        limit, although for long submissions authors should be aware that
        reviewers will not be able to read the entire document in detail. Think
        creatively: you could submit a recent paper, draft notes of a project in
        progress, or even a recent Masters or PhD thesis. Speakers are expected
        to present their contribution in person, and submissions must point out
        who will present the contribution if it is selected.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you have a submission which was deferred from a previous <i>SYCO</i>
        meeting, it will not automatically be considered for this event; if you
        would like to present it, you must submit it again through EasyChair.
        Such a submission will be prioritised for inclusion in the scientific
        programme. When submitting, append the words "DEFERRED FROM SYCO X" to
        the title of your paper, replacing "X" with the appropriate meeting
        number. There is no need to attach any documents.
      </p>

      <h3 id="deferral">Deferral</h3>
      <p>
        The intention is for <i>SYCO</i> to be a community meeting, where people
        have enough time to explain their ideas, and with a friendly and
        non-competitive atmosphere. To encourage this, in the event that more
        submissions are received of an acceptable standard than can be
        accommodated in the timetable, the programme committee may choose to
        <i>defer</i> some submissions to a future meeting, rather than reject
        them. This would be done based largely on submission order, giving an
        incentive for early submission, but would also take into account other
        requirements, such as ensuring a broad and inclusive scientific
        programme. The perceived strength of the submission as judged by the
        reviewers is <i>not</i> taken into account for a deferral decision, so a
        deferral is not in any sense a rejection. Deferred submissions can then
        be re-submitted to any future <i>SYCO</i> meeting, where they will be
        prioritised for inclusion in the programme, and where they will not need
        to be re-reviewed. Meetings are held sufficiently frequently to avoid a
        backlog of deferred papers.
